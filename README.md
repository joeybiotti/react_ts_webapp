# TypeScript React Webapp

A simple web app using React and Redux written in TypeScript. This was done to get more comfortable with React, Redux and TypeScript. The project was bootstrapped using the node package `create-react-app`. 

I followed the guide I found <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter">here</a>.
